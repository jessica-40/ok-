            <h2>1.Bhagat singh</h2>
            <p>Description of Freedom Fighter 1. bhagat singh was a great indian freedom fighter.Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[1] –
                 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[3] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police
                  officer[4] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic 
                  bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in 
                  Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr
                   and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] he electrified a growing militancy in 
                   India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful
                    campaign for India's independence. TO KNOW MORE CLICK ON TO 'LEARN MORE'.....</p>

            <p>Description of Freedom Fighter 2. Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during
                 the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian
                  Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final
                   exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by
                    Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to......TO KNOW MORE CLICK ON TO 'LEARN MORE'.....</p>
